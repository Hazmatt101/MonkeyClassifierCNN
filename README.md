This project was co-created by Andrew Dieken and Matt McCortney for Chapman University's Machine Learning class.

# Purpose
To explore the adaptability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the use of image classification. The program is able to predict species of monkeys and apes.

# Method
Using a large classified image dataset of monkeys from Kaggle, new and unclassified images of monkeys and apes are predicted within <15% margin of error, which is reduced when training with larger datasets. We chose not to use the largest possible dataset due to concerns about computational power required to train the model.
